- **Clients**: ask a question in a category, see their posts and the counsellor's replies, and manage their profile.
- **Counsellors**: an inbox of client questions (`Ubutumwa`) and a reply thread per client.
- **Admin dashboard**: add counsellors and clients, manage users and question categories.
- Authentication with Laravel UI.
